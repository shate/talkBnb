Two weeks after signing the lease agreement my suite mate’s friend backed out!! This was incredibly nerve wracking and inconvenient for my roommate and I:((( A friend of mine then suggested we rent the room out using Talkbnb. 
              We have been using Talkbnb for almost a month now. Not only has the stress of finding a new roommate been relieved, but we have made enough money to cover almost 2/3 of our entire monthly rent!!

          <p>Time is money, and we understand that down time is hard to come by. Speaking with your guest for 2-3 hours a day shouldn’t necessarily mean stealing this time from your family, business, friends  and hobbies! Every day, we perform basic routine tasks, such as cooking a meal, doing laundry, or commuting to and from work. Imagine using this time wisely while spending it with your guest. These tedious tasks can eventually turn into an exciting highlight of your day by simply including your guest. You’ll get more out of your routine schedule without adding extra work. Become more efficient with your time, and get paid for it!</p>

          <p>Talkbnb was designed to give people all over the world the freedom to learn a foreign language in a relaxed setting, without fear of judgment. People study a foreign language at school for years.  They may know all the grammar rules and have a great vocabulary, yet they  are too shy use their language skills freely when the opportunity presents itself. Learning a language can (and must be!) a captivating and stress-free process. When trying to  speak a foreign language, mistakes  are bound to happen. Whether it’s choosing the wrong word or  struggling with correct pronunciation –  it’s all part of the learning process. You will be able to correct your guests’ errors on the spot, providing encouragement that will increase their confidence and fluency.</p>
